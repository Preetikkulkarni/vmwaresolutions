# VMware HCX component-level target architecture with NSX-V deployments
{: #hcx-archi-target-v}

Review the architecture of each VMware® HCX™ component that is deployed within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} environment with NSX-V.

## NSX Edge
{: #hcx-archi-target-v-nsx-edge}

The first component that is configured within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is a pair of NSX Edge virtual machines (VMs). It is important to note that all {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} deployments install and configure an edge device for IBM CloudDriver outbound communication. However, while this ESG can be reused for Hybrid Cloud Services communications, it is advised that a new pair is deployed.

The NSX Edge VMs are configured as an active - passive pair of X-Large NSX Edge devices. These devices are used to connect into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VMware environment by using a public internet connection. The X-Large NSX Edge was chosen for the internal environment since it is suited for environments that have load balancer with millions of concurrent sessions that do not necessarily require high-throughput. As part of the configuration process, the NSX Edge is connected to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} public VLAN and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private VLAN designated for management infrastructure.

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU       | 6 vCPU        |
| RAM       | 8 GB          |
| Disk      | 4.5 GB VMDK resident on shared storage with 4 GB swap |
{: caption="Table 1. NSX Edge deployment" caption-side="top"}

Since the NSX Edges are configured as active-passive in either the internal or dedicated deployment, you must create vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) anti-affinity rules so that NSX Edges do not run on the same host as their respective peer appliance.

| Field     | Value         |
|-----------|---------------|
| Name      | NSX Edge External Gateway |
| Type      | Separate VMs |
| Members   | NSX Edge 1 |
|           | NSX Edge 2 |
{: caption="Table 2. NSX Edge anti-affinity rules" caption-side="top"}

In addition to the NSX Edge appliances deployed within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, the HCX Manager virtual appliance is deployed if the VMware® HCX™ service is ordered. After the deployment of this appliance, the NSX Edge is enabled to use load balancing and is configured with application profiles that use a certificate for inbound connection from the source. The NSX Edge is also configured with load-balancing pools to point to the HCX Manager, vCenter, and PSC appliances. Additionally, a virtual server is created with a virtual IP address (VIP) on the public interface with rules that connect the pools with VIP. A sample of the virtual server configuration and pool configuration on the NSX Edge is shown in the following tables.

| Field     | Value         |
|-----------|---------------|
| Virtual Server ID | virtualServer-1 |
| Name | HCX-VIP |
| Description | LB-VIP |
| Default Pool | pool-1 |

## HCX Manager
{: #hcx-archi-target-v-hcxm}

The HCX Manager component is the first appliance that is deployed after the NSX Edge appliances are configured on the target. This appliance is used as the main interface into the cloud environment for the source components. It provides an abstracted networking user interface that can be used to add, edit, and delete networks, and to design and configure routing without direct use of NSX. As a result of the vCenter and NSX integration, the HCX Manager appliance is assigned a private portable IP address on the management VLAN.

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU       | 4 vCPU        |
| RAM       | 12 GB          |
| Disk      | 60 GB VMDK resident on shared storage |
{: caption="Table 4. HCX Manager" caption-side="top"}

Additionally, it is configured to access vCenter and NSX with a specific user. It is important to note that the HCX Manager’s IP address is the same IP address that is used in the NSX edge for load balancing.

After the HCX Manager cloud component is deployed and configured, the source components create a connection to the HCX Manager through the VIP addresses configured in the NSX ESG. After this connection is made, the HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance and HCX WAN Optimizer appliances are deployed within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

## HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance
{: #hcx-archi-target-v-hcx-ix}

A virtual appliance is deployed after a connection is established from the source to the target cloud. This appliance is the HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance (CGW) and is used to maintain a secure channel between vSphere environment that is designated as the source and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

The following table shows the sizing specification of the CGW appliance that is deployed within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU       | 8 vCPU        |
| RAM       | 3 GB          |
| Disk      | 2 GB VMDK resident on shared storage |
{: caption="Table 5. HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance deployment" caption-side="top"}

This HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance is deployed and configured to be on the management VLAN (Private Portable Subnet) and on the vMotion VLAN (Private Portable Subnet) of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} deployment. Additionally, another interface is configured on the Public VLAN (Public Portable) for connections that are made over the public internet. Public access is not required if a direct connection exists (private connection in place). The last connection that is associated with the HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance is a logical switch that is created and configured upon site pairing.

## HCX WAN Optimizer
{: #hcx-archi-targetv-hcx-wo}

The second component that is deployed is the WAN Optimization appliance. While the WAN Optimization appliance is optional, it performs WAN conditioning to reduce effects of latency. It also incorporates Forward Error Correction to negate packet loss scenarios, and deduplication of redundant traffic patterns.

Altogether, these reduce bandwidth use and ensure the best use of available network capacity to expedite data transfer to and from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The HCX WAN Optimizer is disk intensive and requires sufficient amount of IOPS to function properly. As a result, the HCX WAN Optimizer is on vSAN storage (if present), or on the Endurance storage with 2,000 IOPS.

The following table shows the sizing specification for the WAN Optimization appliance.

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU       | 8 vCPU        |
| RAM       | 14 GB         |
| Disk      | 100 GB VMDK resident on shared storage / 5000 IOPS |
{: caption="Table 6. HCX WAN Optimizer appliance sizing" caption-side="top"}

Unlike the HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance, the WAN Optimization appliance is only attached to a logical switch to enable communication between itself and the HCX-IX Interconnect Appliance. This appliance is required if WAN optimization is in use within the source environment.

## HCX Network Extension Virtual Appliance
{: #hcx-archi-target-v-hcx-ne}

The third component is known as the HCX Network Extension Virtual Appliance (HCX-NE) and is part of the Network Extension Services. The HCX-NE is the VM that allows the extension of on-premises datacenter networks to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The HCX-NE stretches on-premises VLANs or VXLANs. Each HCX-NE can stretch up to 4096 VLANs. Each HCX-NE, when paired with its on-premises partner can provide up to 1 Gbps per “flow” and up to an aggregate of 4 Gbps per VLAN (or VXLAN). Deployment of more HCX-NE appliances is supported if more network throughputs are required.

As part of this design, the HCX-NE appliance is deployed so that you can stretch multiple VLANs and VLXANs into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} over the Internet or through the private network by using Direct-Link. The sizing specification of the HCX-NE appliance on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is listed in the following table.

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU       | 8 vCPU        |
| RAM       | 3 GB          |
| Disk      | 2 GB VMDK on shared storage |
{: caption="Table 7. HCX Network Extension Virtual Appliance sizing" caption-side="top"}

The HCX-NE appliance is deployed on the management VLAN and on the public VLAN. The public interface is used for application traffic that bound for the source of the extended network. More connections such as the extended networks, are created and attached to the HCX-NE appliance after the source administrator initiates the network extension into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
